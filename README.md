## Project Overview

This project aims to classify images of potato plants into different categories based on their health status. Using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), the model predicts whether a potato plant is affected by early blight, late blight, or is healthy. The project utilizes TensorFlow and Keras for building and training the model.
